    p(id= "description") I am a semi-self taught programmer that develops and contributes to some open source projects. I have experience with JavaScript, Python, Java, Lua, MATLAB, and C. I also have experience with some other programming languages to a lesser degree. Some projects I have developed have included Minecraft mods and Discord bots, as well as some webpages.
