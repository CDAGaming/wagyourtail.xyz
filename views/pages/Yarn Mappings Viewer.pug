    h2 Viewer for the Fabric minecraft mappings
    p(id= "description") In order to use JsMacros better I needed an easy to use viewer for the yarn mappings. this is to get the intermediate and mapped class names, It should be useful for other people as well, but not many people need the obfuscated names. 
        | I'll probably make it look a little better at some point in the future, but for now it doesn't have much styling, much like the rest of this website.
